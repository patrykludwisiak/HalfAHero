nivekTutorial1=If we keep slacking like that, we won't get to the festival any time soon.
nivekTutorial2=Oh really?.
nivekTutorial3=Ouch! Someone crashed their boat on the river.
nivekTutorial4=Hmmmpf!
nivekTutorial5=We might salvage something from it. Can you jump over there?
nivekTutorial6=Hmmmm, maybe because I have to carry that huge ressurection crystal?
nivekTutorial7=You'll be fine.
nivekTutorial8=Nice shield. A bit rusty, but it will do.
nivekTutorial9=Now let's go, or we'll really be late.
nivekTutorial10=Hmmm, it shouldn't be so windy here.
nivekTutorial11=There is a ruined temple behind that hill, and I think that's the source of this wind.
nivekTutorial12=Really?! A tree had to fall right here!?
nivekTutorial13=Can you smash it with your shield?
nivekTutorial14=O SHOOT! GHOSTS!
nivekTutorial15=Ok, the wind should be coming from down there, but our passage is blocked.
nivekTutorial16=Maybe we could open a way with those runes.
nivekTutorial17=Great!
nivekTutorial18=AAAA! More of them!
nivekTutorial19=They're manipulating that crystal! It is probably causing that wind!
nivekTutorial20=We must destroy it! Take care of that and I'll watch your back!
nivekTutorial21=Let's get out of here!
nivekTutorial22=Off! We've done it! And it's no longer blowing.
nivekTutorial23=Maybe we can finally get on that festival.
nivekTutorial24=WHAT THE HECK HAPPEND HERE!?

playerTutorial1=I am just keeping your tempo!
playerTutorial2=Why don't you do that!?
